# Escape Room

## Overview
This escape room was a part of a project during my internship with Teens in Public Service, a Seattle-based educational non-profit for low-income students of color.

Scenario: The coronavirus has mutated into a zombie virus! You have come across the following computer after journeying to Seattle Children's Hospital, where there is supposedly a cure.  Hack into the computer by finding the password, and save the world!

## Quickstart
This project was originally deployed on an AWS EC2 machine, but it could be easier deployed with Python 3.

Warning: Site is not fully functional on local server.

Clone the project from Github

```git clone https://github.com/ProfJAT/escape-room.git```

Open the terminal and enter the directory

```cd Your/Directory/Github/escape-room```

Run a local HTTP server

```python -m http.server```

Enjoy at localhost:8000!
