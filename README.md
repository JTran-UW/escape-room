# Escape Room

## Overview
This escape room was a part of a project during my internship with Teens in Public Service, a Seattle-based educational non-profit for low-income students of color.  
Scenario: The coronavirus has mutated into a zombie virus! You have come across the following computer after journeying to Seattle Children's Hospital, where there is supposedly a cure.  Hack into the computer by finding the password, and save the world!
